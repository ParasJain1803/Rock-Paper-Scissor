# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows a player to compete against the computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

- **Game Status Display**: Shows the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result (win, lose, or draw).
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's and computer's scores throughout the session.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the game interface and score display.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game layout, buttons, and overall appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including random computer moves, determining the winner, and updating scores.
